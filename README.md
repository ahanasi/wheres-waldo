# Where's Waldo

Check it out here --> [Where's Waldo](https://wheres-waldo-c76a2.web.app/)

Built as part of the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app).

This React-based photo-tagging game displays a large photograph which contains certain characters the user is meant to find, e.g. Waldo, Wilma, Wizard White Beard etc. Firebase was used as the backend - Firestore and Cloud Functions were used for validating user guesses and maintaining the leaderboard, while Cloud Storage was used to store the photographs used within the game.
